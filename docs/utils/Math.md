### Math Utilities

Mathematical functions for vector operations and common calculations.

#### Vector Operations

- `dotProduct(vectorA, vectorB)`: Calculates the dot product of two vectors.
- `cosineSimilarity(vectorA, vectorB)`: Measures similarity between two vectors (-1.0 to 1.0).
- `normalizeVector()`: Normalizes a list of doubles.
- `isNormalizedVector()`: Checks if a vector is normalized (with floating-point tolerance).

#### Shortcuts

- `powOfTwo()`: Extension for `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, and `Double`.
